    title: Rochester
    description: Looking out over the river Medway, Rochester strikes an impressive pose with a vast Norman keep and ancient cathedral forming the old-world skyline of this Kent town. Crooked houses and cobbled streets are the makeup of the main town arteries, hosting indie gift shops, boutiques and cafes and restaurants. Dickens spent a lot of time here, using the setting to inspire his fiction – find names of his characters inscribed on headstones in the cemetery, or on the names of the buildings around town. Head for the castle grounds at sunset for gorgeous views over the river and valley that Rochester bookends.

        title: Dickens House Wine Emporium
        description: In the 19th century, a rather famous novelist would pop in to this former apothecary to cure all sorts of ailments and grievances. Now, you too can follow in Charles Dickens’ footsteps and nurse yourself back to health with a fine selection of wines from across the world. From floor to ceiling, the shelves here are stacked with a magnificent array of tipples, each chosen by the family owners.
      - id: nucleus-arts
        title: Nucleus Arts
        description: This Rochester outpost of the Medway charity is a hub of creativity for the town. The premise of the charity is to promote the art and creativity of Medway locals, supporting emerging artists and showcasing their work in the shop. It’s all available to purchase, with a lot of the subjects based on local sights and happenings.
      - id: topes-restaurant
        title: Topes Restaurant
        description: Set within a timbered 15th century building in the heart of Rochester, Topes offers fine dining that has made it a favourite amongst locals. This family-run restaurant may reside in a gloriously historic setting, but its menu is firmly modern. From pressure-cooked beef cheek to Barbary duck breast, all ingredients are locally sourced – which, rather surprisingly, extends to the wine selection. Head there on a Friday night to sample the Dickensian delights of their ‘Gin Palace’.

  - id: faversham
    title: Faversham
    description: This quiet market town is a perfect stop-off before you reach the bigger towns further down the line. Home to Britain’s oldest brewery, Shepherd Neame, plus a host of inviting Kentish pubs serving fresh pints of the local brew, Faversham is awash with quaint countryside charms. Plan your visit for either Tuesday, Friday or Saturday, when the whole town turns into one big market – from vintage treasures to delicious local produce, the event makes Faversham a truly unmissable stop on the line.

  - id: canterbury
    title: Canterbury
    description: Canter pilgrim, under vast medieval gates that open to a beguiling city of medieval mysteries and memorable escapes. Canterbury is awash with stories – from the cathedral whispers of martyrdom and murder, the eponymous Tales of a colourful cast of pilgrims, to Shakespearean rivals meeting an untimely end in bar fights. Craft your own story and discover a city of remarkable beauty, where bars and restaurants frame an indulgent escape in this middle-Kent sanctuary.

        title: The Goods Shed
        description: In an old railway shed next to the clatter of the train tracks is a foodie hotspot, one that delights in offering an irresistible selection of local Kentish produce and artisanal fayre. A restaurant adjoins the mini-market inside, where you can browse all manner of delicious goods. Build-your-own breakfast in the morning, browse the farmer’s market, and come back for an unmissable dinner made with the finest Kentish produce.
      - id: st-martin-s-church
        title: St Martin’s Church
        description: Canterbury Cathedral may prove the most popular historical sight in town, but it’s by no means alone. Oft overlooked, this small, unassuming church is but a short walk from the centre of town – and, quite remarkably, the oldest church in the English-speaking world. Roman foundations were renovated by Saxon king Æthelberht of Kent, so his Christian wife Bertha could practice her faith. Its historical significance is at odds with its unassuming stature – a truly charming and utterly beguiling place.

        title: Revivals
        description: This high street stalwart has been offering fine vintage threads since it was opened by Debbie Barwick in 1988. Whether you’re looking for that perfect pre-war gown, or a sharp ivy-league button down, you’ll find it in this packed emporium of sartorial finesse. Debbie has an eye for the classic and the oddball; if it’s from the 20s to the 70s, you’ll find it on the sagging racks that fill this small, yet packed, little gem.
      - id: boho-cafe
        title: Boho Cafe
        description: This local’s haunt on the high street lives up to its moniker – bohemian vibes wash over this cute little brunch spot, with a small smattering of outdoor tables made for people watching. The breakfasts here are renowned, a perfect way to start a day of exploration. Sit in the rear garden, an eccentric, cosy space perfect for distracting yourself from the hustle and bustle of the high street.
      - id: greyfriars-chapel
        title: Greyfriars Chapel
        description: Hidden behind the Eastbridge Hospital, the 12th-century pilgrim’s hospital, sits this rather unassuming building. The chapel was actually part of the first Franciscan monastery in Britain, built in 1267. Now, the gardens surrounding this romantic medieval structure make for a wonderfully picturesque picnic spot. Sit near the quiet stream and soak up the unique atmosphere, all just a stone’s throw from Buttermarket.
      - id: marlowe-s
        title: Marlowe’s
        description: Marlowe’s is a Canterbury stalwart, with a formula unchanged since 1984. Close to the theatre that shares its name with the famous playwright, Marlowe’s has long been the pre-show dinner spot for locals. A rather mish-mash menu that seemingly spans the globe, Marlowe’s is one of those old-school, family-run places where you kind of get what you’re given – in all its rich, indulgent glory. Don’t miss this classic Canterbury fave.
