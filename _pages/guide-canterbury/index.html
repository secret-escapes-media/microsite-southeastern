    title: Whitstable
    description: One of the most beautiful seaside towns in Kent, Whitstable is famed for its glorious oyster heritage, a high street packed with quaint independent shops, and irresistibly picturesque beaches. With vintage outfitters, antique shops galore and a healthy dose of great bars and seafood restaurants, Whitstable has become a chic weekend retreat for savvy Londoners. Don’t miss the narrow smuggler’s alleyways that run off the high street to the beach!

        title: West Whelks
        description: In the old harbour of Whitstable you’ll find the unassuming black and white stand run by Derek West, the oldest working fisherman in Britain. For over 70 years Derek has been picking whelks with his family each morning, hauled fresh and brought to the timbered harbour building. His oysters are some of the best in the town, and his old fishing boat so part of the fabric of Whitstable it now resides in the town’s museum.

        title: Old Neptune sunset
        description: The Old Neptune pub is a cosy hideaway sat right on the beach, a perfect pit-stop during a walk along the coast. It’s white timber frame makes it a recognised landmark in the town, but its best attribute comes around each evening. The sunsets here are glorious, making it a favourite amongst photographers. Grab a pint of local ale and sit outside for irresistible views across the sea.

        title: Micro-pub-crawl
        description: Kent is no stranger to real ale – the hops grown here are coveted. Whitstable even has its own microbrewery, and as a refreshing complement, a handful of hidden micro-pubs. Old shop fronts are fitted out with casks and kitsch, stools and beer mats, making for a unique setting to share a few local tipples. The Handsome Sam, The Twelve Taps, The Black Dog and the Tankerton Arms offer a unique and cosy atmosphere for trying a vast variety of wonderfully-hopped beers, from IPAs to Porters.
  - id: faversham
    title: Faversham
    description: This quiet market town is a perfect stop-off before you reach the bigger towns further down the line. Home to Britain’s oldest brewery, Shepherd Neame, plus a host of inviting Kentish pubs serving fresh pints of the local brew, Faversham is awash with quaint countryside charms. Plan your visit for either Tuesday, Friday or Saturday, when the whole town turns into one big market – from vintage treasures to delicious local produce, the event makes Faversham a truly unmissable stop on the line.
  - id: canterbury
    title: Canterbury
    description: Canter pilgrim, under vast medieval gates that open to a beguiling city of medieval mysteries and memorable escapes. Canterbury is awash with stories – from the cathedral whispers of martyrdom and murder, the eponymous Tales of a colourful cast of pilgrims, to Shakespearean rivals meeting an untimely end in bar fights. Craft your own story and discover a city of remarkable beauty, where bars and restaurants frame an indulgent escape in this middle-Kent sanctuary.

        title: The Goods Shed
        description: In an old railway shed next to the clatter of the train tracks is a foodie hotspot, one that delights in offering an irresistible selection of local Kentish produce and artisanal fayre. A restaurant adjoins the mini-market inside, where you can browse all manner of delicious goods. Build-your-own breakfast in the morning, browse the farmer’s market, and come back for an unmissable dinner made with the finest Kentish produce.
      - id: st-martin-s-church
        title: St Martin’s Church
        description: Canterbury’s cathedral may prove the most popular historical sight in town, but it’s by no means alone. Oft overlooked, this small, unassuming church is but a short walk from the centre of town – and, quite remarkably, the oldest church in the English-speaking world. Roman foundations were renovated by Saxon king Æthelberht of Kent, so his Christian wife Bertha could practice her faith. Its historical significance is at odds with its unassuming stature – a truly charming and utterly beguiling place.

        title: Revivals
        description: This high street stalwart has been offering fine vintage threads since it was opened by Debbie Barwick in 1988. Whether you’re looking for that perfect pre-war gown, or a sharp ivy-league button down, you’ll find it in this packed emporium of sartorial finesse. Debbie has an eye for the classic and the oddball; if it’s from the 20s to the 70s, you’ll find it on the sagging racks that fill this small, yet packed, little gem.
      - id: boho-cafe
        title: Boho Cafe
        description: This local’s haunt on the high street lives up to its moniker – bohemian vibes wash over this cute little brunch spot, with a small smattering of outdoor tables made for people watching. The breakfasts here are renowned, a perfect way to start a day of exploration. Sit in the rear garden, an eccentric, cosy space perfect for distracting yourself from the hustle and bustle of the high street.
      - id: greyfriars-chapel
        title: Greyfriars Chapel
        description: Hidden behind the Eastbridge Hospital, the 12th-century pilgrim’s hospital, sits this rather unassuming building. The chapel was actually part of the first Franciscan monastery in Britain, built in 1267. Now, the gardens surrounding this romantic medieval structure make for a wonderfully picturesque picnic spot. Sit near the quiet stream and soak up the unique atmosphere, all just a stone’s throw from Buttermarket.
      - id: marlowe-s
        title: Marlowe’s
        description: Marlowe’s is a Canterbury stalwart, with a formula unchanged since 1984. Close to the theatre that shares its name with the famous playwright, Marlowe’s has long been the pre-show dinner spot for locals. A rather mish-mash menu that seemingly spans the globe, Marlowe’s is one of those old-school, family-run places where you kind of get what you’re given – in all its rich, indulgent glory. Don’t miss this classic Canterbury fave.
  - id: sandwich
    title: Sandwich
    description: This remarkable little town is a medieval treasure, once a hugely important port that slowly sidled into obscurity. For this reason, there’s a wealth of fantastic medieval buildings here, with the majority of the town’s centre having listed status. Riverside dining and creaky, thatched-roof pubs make this a truly charming Kentish getaway, with plenty of historical sights to explore, seal spotting tours to embark on, and all the country indulgence you would expect.
