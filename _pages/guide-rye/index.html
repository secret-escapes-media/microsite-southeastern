    title: Tunbridge Wells
    description: This charming town amongst the rolling landscape of High Weald has long drawn visitors from London. A historic spa town, the Georgian and Victorian architecture makes for picturesque walks down streets packed with boutiques, cafes and pubs. Green spaces line the fringes of the high street, a perfect retreat for city dwellers. Tunbridge Wells’ most prized landmark is The Pantiles, the beautifully picturesque lines of shops colonnaded and covered, where all manner of stylish businesses offer their wares to visitors. Pitch up outside one of the restaurants or pubs and relax in this charming town.

    title: Hastings
    description: A once fashionable Victorian resort, Hastings has reinvented itself as a wonderful mix of classic seaside charms and stylish hub of creatives, with a smattering of indie businesses offering fine wares to savvy visitors. Head for the pier with fish and chips in hand, brave the cliffside funicular and walk the pretty streets of the Old Town, finding bargains in the town’s many antique and bric-a-brac stores. Discover design-forward boutiques, record shops, craft bars and more – it’s a town of two very different experiences that somehow seamlessly fit together.

        title: Robert’s Rummage
        description: There’s plenty of antique and junk shops to pick from in Hastings Old Town, but Robert’s Rummage is a pretty special place. Robert has been dealing in curios and vintage his whole life and is a bit of an institution here in Hastings. He’s an old collector with a keen eye, now selling off parts of his vast collection and sharing incredible stories with those who lend an ear. Across the road you’ll find his sister shop, Robert’s Curios, specialising in Oriental antiques – both are a treasure in fine vintage pieces, delicately stacked in an intimidating mess of organised chaos. A true delight for bargain hunters.

        title: Reeves & Son
        description: This is the oldest shop in Hastings. That’s right, Reeves & Son has been offering its wares since 1818. It’s reason enough to visit, walking in the footsteps of Victorian visitors clamouring for a bargain. This really is the epicentre of Hastings’ love of antiques and curiosities, piled high with vintage classics and oddball bric-a-brac. The stock isn’t much different from what was being sold back in the 19th century – be sure to ask the owner Chris to show you some of the old photos of the shop!

        title: A G Hendy & Co Homestore
        description: An Edwardian time machine and a totally unexpected marvel in Hastings, A G Hendy is the remarkable vision of Alastair Hendy. One part homestore, one part restaurant, A G Hendy is a shop for the curious, decked in vintage fittings and Edwardian sensibility. Purchase home wares, be they vintage or picked from esteemed designers, and delight at the extraordinary interior of the shop. Book ahead for the hidden kitchen at the back of the shop, hosting evenings of impeccable dining with locally-sourced produce in a rather unique setting.
      - id: first-in-last-out
        title: First In Last Out
        description: Known as ‘Filo’ to locals, First In Last Out is a quirky watering-hole that feels every bit ‘70s throwback. A brewpub since before the times of trendy craft beer (remember those?), alight at the bar for pints of cask ale brewed in-house and a menu of pub classics. Occasional live music completes the trad pub feel, where splitting hairs with locals is positively encouraged. This is a far-cry from those soulless gastropubs that are all too common these days – instead, enjoy a proper pub, with proper beer, and a proper good knees-up until the bell rings.
      - id: warp-weft
        title: Warp & Weft
        description: This boutique exemplifies the creativity that has nestled in the Hastings indie landscape. Owner Leida Nassir Pour curates a ready-to-wear collection of timeless pieces, brought together by her love of textiles and design-forward craft. A made-to-order service ensures you’ll receive classic design that will last, made by select makers overseen by Leida. Accessories and homeware, plus choice vintage pieces that complement Leida’s aesthetic, make Warp & Weft a stylish boutique for Hastings trend-setters.

        title: Borough Wine, Beer and Books
        description: Hankering for a good bottle to catch the sunset on the beach? Borough Wine, Beer and Books is a perfect spot for picking up a delicious bottle from a curated selection of small producers worldwide. Owner Muriel Chatel started off in London’s Borough Market on a small stall and now owns eight shops – this one being the first venture outside of London. It’s a model that clearly works – quality wines, craft beers and select books offer all you need for inspired nights in Hastings. The best bit? Refill bottles. That’s right, buy an empty bottle and fill it up straight from the cask, saving you money on gorgeous house wines.
  - id: rye
    title: Rye
    description: It’s rare to find a town so picturesque – Rye is an old-world jewel, a medieval, cobbled, creaky town that is perhaps one of the most beautiful on the south coast. Tumbling Tudor buildings line the high street and alleyways, connected by cobbles and mystery. Medieval gates bookmark quaint streets and ancient towers, with whispers of ghosts and smugglers overheard in crooked pubs. Alight at classic tea rooms, discover fine restaurants serving the catch of the day, and let the beauty of Rye inspire your getaway.

        title: Simon the Pieman
        description: You should really go here for the name alone. The name sets it apart from the many tearooms that line the medieval streets of Rye – and it also happens to be the oldest, established in 1920. Alight to fulfill your scone, cream and jam desires, with a rather kitsch interior completing this rather quintessentially British pursuit. A roaring fire in winter makes this a tempting space to seek respite from miserable weather, with a nice brew and selection of unmissable sweet treats.

        title: Grammar School Records
        description: The striking red-brick building on the High Street of Rye, founded in 1636, was for most of its time a grammar school. The last thing you would expect when peering through the old classroom windows is crates and crates of LPs, 45s and all sorts of musical ephemera clinging to the walls. This old-school record shop is a great spot for a rummage, digging out that movie soundtrack or prized piece of vinyl that has since evaded you. The knowledgeable owners are warm and friendly, happy to help you in your digging in this rather remarkable space.
      - id: webbe-s-at-the-fish-cafe
        title: Webbe's at The Fish Cafe
        description: All locals will rave about this coveted fish restaurant. Produce is fresh from Rye harbour, brought straight to the cafe ready for that evening’s menu. The converted warehouse space is a chic spot for a delectable fish supper, with an open kitchen adding to the unique atmosphere. Owners Paul and Rebecca Webbe have already proved they know a thing or two, following their successes at the sister restaurant The Wild Mushroom – both now held in very high esteem. For typical seaside fayre, expertly dished up and brought to your table, look no further than Webbe’s.
