    title: Tunbridge Wells
    description: This charming town amongst the rolling landscape of High Weald has long drawn visitors from London. A historic spa town, the Georgian and Victorian architecture makes for picturesque walks down streets packed with boutiques, cafes and pubs. Green spaces line the fringes of the high street, a perfect retreat for city dwellers. Tunbridge Wells’ most prized landmark is The Pantiles, the beautifully picturesque lines of shops colonnaded and covered, where all manner of stylish businesses offer their wares to visitors. Pitch up outside one of the restaurants or pubs and relax in this charming town.

    title: Battle
    description: There’s really only one reason to hop off the train in Battle and there’s one, very large clue in the name. Just behind the charming village high street, packed with pubs and restaurants, bakers and butchers, is one of the most important historic sites in the whole of England. This is the place where the Battle of Hastings was fought in 1066, between the Saxon king Harold and Norman invader William. Now, the commemorative Battle Abbey built by the victor (William obviously!) marks the entrance to the battlefield. Don’t miss country quirks like the effigy-burning Battel Bonfire Boyes, in a market-village packed with English history.

    title: Hastings
    description: A once fashionable Victorian resort, Hastings has reinvented itself as a wonderful mix of classic seaside charms and stylish hub of creatives, with a smattering of indie businesses offering fine wares to savvy visitors. Head for the pier with fish and chips in hand, brave the cliffside funicular and walk the pretty streets of the Old Town, finding bargains in the town’s many antique and bric-a-brac stores. Discover design-forward boutiques, record shops, craft bars and more – it’s a town of two very different experiences that somehow seamlessly fit together.

        title: Robert’s Rummage
        description: There’s plenty of antique and junk shops to pick from in Hastings Old Town, but Robert’s Rummage is a pretty special place. Robert has been dealing in curios and vintage his whole life and is a bit of an institution here in Hastings. He’s an old collector with a keen eye, now selling off parts of his vast collection and sharing incredible stories with those who lend an ear. Across the road you’ll find his sister shop, Robert’s Curios, specialising in Oriental antiques – both are a treasure in fine vintage pieces, delicately stacked in an intimidating mess of organised chaos. A true delight for bargain hunters.

        title: Reeves & Son
        description: This is the oldest shop in Hastings. That’s right, Reeves & Son has been offering its wares since 1818. It’s reason enough to visit, walking in the footsteps of Victorian visitors clamouring for a bargain. This really is the epicentre of Hastings’ love of antiques and curiosities, piled high with vintage classics and oddball bric-a-brac. The stock isn’t much different from what was being sold back in the 19th century – be sure to ask the owner Chris to show you some of the old photos of the shop!

        title: A G Hendy & Co
        description: An Edwardian time machine and a totally unexpected marvel in Hastings, A G Hendy is the remarkable vision of Alastair Hendy. One part homestore, one part restaurant, A G Hendy is a shop for the curious, decked in vintage fittings and Edwardian sensibility. Purchase home wares, be they vintage or picked from esteemed designers, and delight at the extraordinary interior of the shop. Book ahead for the hidden kitchen at the back of the shop, hosting evenings of impeccable dining with locally-sourced produce in a rather unique setting.

        title: First In Last Out
        description: Known as ‘Filo’ to locals, First In Last Out is a quirky watering-hole that feels every bit ‘70s throwback. A brewpub since before the times of trendy craft beer (remember those?), alight at the bar for pints of cask ale brewed in-house and a menu of pub classics. Occasional live music completes the trad pub feel, where splitting hairs with locals is positively encouraged. This is a far-cry from those soulless gastropubs that are all too common these days – instead, enjoy a proper pub, with proper beer, and a proper good knees-up until the bell rings.

        title: Warp & Weft
        description: This boutique exemplifies the creativity that has nestled in the Hastings indie landscape. Owner Leida Nassir Pour curates a ready-to-wear collection of timeless pieces, brought together by her love of textiles and design-forward craft. A made-to-order service ensures you’ll receive classic design that will last, made by select makers overseen by Leida. Accessories and homeware, plus choice vintage pieces that complement Leida’s aesthetic, make Warp & Weft a stylish boutique for Hastings trend-setters.

        title: Borough Wine, Beer and Books
        description: Hankering for a good bottle to catch the sunset on the beach? Borough Wine, Beer and Books is a perfect spot for picking up a delicious bottle from a curated selection of small producers worldwide. Owner Muriel Chatel started off in London’s Borough Market on a small stall and now owns eight shops – this one being the first venture outside of London. It’s a model that clearly works – quality wines, craft beers and select books offer all you need for inspired nights in Hastings. The best bit? Refill bottles. That’s right, buy an empty bottle and fill it up straight from the cask, saving you money on gorgeous house wines.
