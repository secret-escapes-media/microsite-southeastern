        title: West Whelks
        description: In the old harbour of Whitstable you’ll find the unassuming black and white stand run by Derek West, the oldest working fisherman in Britain. For over 70 years Derek has been picking whelks with his family each morning, hauled fresh and brought to the timbered harbour building. His oysters are some of the best in the town, and his old fishing boat so part of the fabric of Whitstable it now resides in the town’s museum.
      - id: old-neptune-sunset
        title: Old Neptune sunset
        description: The Old Neptune pub is a cosy hideaway sat right on the beach, a perfect pit-stop during a walk along the coast. It’s white timber frame makes it a recognised landmark in the town, but its best attribute comes around each evening. The sunsets here are glorious, making it a favourite amongst photographers. Grab a pint of local ale and sit outside for irresistible views across the sea.
      - id: micro-pub-crawl
        title: Micro-pub-crawl
        description: Kent is no stranger to real ale – the hops grown here are coveted. Whitstable even has its own microbrewery, and as a refreshing complement, a handful of hidden micro-pubs. Old shop fronts are fitted out with casks and kitsch, stools and beer mats, making for a unique setting to share a few local tipples. The Handsome Sam, The Twelve Taps, The Black Dog and the Tankerton Arms offer a unique and cosy atmosphere for trying a vast variety of wonderfully-hopped beers, from IPAs to Porters.

  - id: ramsgate
    title: Ramsgate
    description: Ramsgate has a rather unique, undiscovered allure to it. Regency architecture and Victorian splendour harks back to better days, yet there is an air of change in the town. More and more indie boutiques and cafes are setting up shop, offering an alternative escape to Margate. The Royal Harbour (the only one in the country) now houses vintage dealers, restaurants and boutiques in its arches, with plenty opportunity to sit back with ocean views at one of the bars or cafes. Serene coastal walks take you up to Broadstairs, making Ramsgate a great base for exploring the northeastern coastline of Kent.

      - id: flavours-by-kumar
        title: Flavours by Kumar
        description: Wandering through some of the less pretty streets in Ramsgate, stumble upon this former pub – a fine treasure awaits. Don’t let appearances fool you; Flavours by Kumar is one of the finest Indian restaurants in the South East. Chef Anil Kumar cut his cloth in a host of dinner spots across India, Dubai, Jordan and London, before opening this coveted restaurant in Ramsgate. Enjoy contemporary Indian dining on the Kent coast.
      - id: petticoat-lane-emporium
        title: Petticoat Lane Emporium
        description: Treasure hunters and bargain seekers alight! Petticoat Lane Emporium is a treasure trove of vintage, antiques and bric-a-brac. It’s so good it featured on Antiques Road Trip, which is a fine reason to visit. A vast hall hosts a large collection of stallholders, each offering a vast range of curios, antiques, retro cool and rare treasures. Walk the golden path that navigates you around this packed-out hall and find your perfect vintage gems.
      - id: vinyl-head-cafe
        title: Vinyl Head Cafe
        description: Brunch, coffee and records – a winning combination that delights hip locals. Venture in and smell the rich roast on offer and kick-back with a light bite or sumptuous cake. Records spin in the background, with LPs displaying their art on the walls enticing you to crate dig through the strong selection of vinyl. Vinyl Head Cafe fosters local talent with intimate live performances on certain days, making this a one-stop-shop of all things musical.

  - id: broadstairs
    title: Broadstairs
    description: Broadstairs is easily one of the most picturesque Victorian seaside towns in the country. Slung high on cliffs around a crescent-shaped bay, it’s small enough to feel wonderfully quaint, yet with enough happening to make it a great weekend destination. It’s dining scene packs a real punch, with smart restaurants serving acclaimed British fayre. Don’t miss Bleak House, where Dickens spent many a summer, before heading for a pub garden that overlooks the irresistible charm of Viking Bay.

      - id: morelli-s
        title: Morelli’s
        description: Quite possibly the last thing you’d expect in this rather typically British seaside town is an old-school Italian gelato spot. It becomes even more remarkable when you realise that the Morelli’s have been in business since 1907! The current site has been delighting visitors since 1937, with a colourful display of homemade gelato. It’s mid-century design makes it every bit a time-warp, retro hangout for sharp modernistas, where formica, soda fountains and espressos reign supreme. An unmissable stalwart.
      - id: the-chapel
        title: The Chapel
        description: There’s a lot in a name, but appearances can be deceptive; yes, this is a chapel. A rather old one at that, dating to 1601. But open the doors and the first thing you’ll notice is books. Lots and lots of books, split over the ground floor and a mezzanine – but again, deception is at play! Because there’s live music, and loads of cask ale, and a bar. That’s right, the Chapel is a micropub and a music venue, in a bookshop, in a chapel. A truly unique space to hang with locals over local brews feasting on local produce. Delicious.
      - id: botany-bay
        title: Botany Bay
        description: On the stretch of coast that joins Broadstairs to Margate hides one of the most beautiful beaches in England. Botany Bay, a picturesque walk out of Broadstairs, is less visited than its more popular neighbour, Joss Bay. Steep, white cliffs fall steeply down to a long stretch of soft sands. Find a set of stairs or a slope that’s easy to climb down and head for the beach, where tall chalk stacks pierce the sands and a network of smugglers caves make for hours of fun exploration.

  - id: margate
    title: Margate
    description: A certain on-trend revival has gripped Margate over the last few years. It seems the old Victoriana that lines the beachfront is finally being returned to its halcyon days, with a new influx of entrepreneurs and hip visitors making Margate cool again. Many attribute this to the Turner Contemporary opening, but that would do a disservice to the people of this trendy seaside destination. With the kitsch vintage cool of Dreamland growing from strength to strength, a great collection of vintage shops and boutiques, up-and-coming foodie scene and, of course, bars, pubs and seaside, Margate is a firm favourite along the Kent coastline.

      - id: shell-grotto
        title: Shell Grotto
        description: Margate’s best-known hidden gem, a self-aware oxymoron, Shell Grotto is a rather perplexing oddity that makes it an unmissable attraction. At the back of a small shop, on an unassuming residential street a short walk out of town, is the entrance to a rather spectacular, delicately beautiful, network of caves lined by all manner of shells. The patterns are artistic, the scene breathtaking. This awe is soon met with perplexity – why? How? When? Well, no one knows! For that, you’ll just have to see it for yourself...
      - id: roller-disco
        title: Roller Disco
        description: Dreamland may be on everyone’s lips when Margate is mentioned, yet did you know it had a roller disco? Like, an actual roller rink, with lights, neon, and disco? Well soul brothers and soul sisters, that’s right. You can disco late into the night (well, til 8pm, but keep an eye out for special nights!) practicing your grapevine, moonwalk and spread eagle all to the right-on sounds of Candi Staton, Margie Joseph and Gwen McCrae.
      - id: fort-s-cafe
        title: Fort’s Cafe
        description: This classic seaside cafe (drop the e, this is the south after all!) is a great metaphor for what’s happening in Margate. Take a classic seaside institution, add a touch of cool, aim to serve the best produce you can, but keep the fabric of the place intact. Fort’s does just this. On the Cliftonville seafront sits this kitsch brunch hangout, serving glorious British fry-ups and an unmissable array of other mid-morning treats. Fort’s is the best place to start your day in Margate.
      - id: the-sun-deck
        title: The Sun Deck
        description: At the far end of the beach toward the station stands a big red bus. This is your marker; head for it with an empty belly and discover a little foodie mecca right on the beach. The Sun Deck is a collection of street food vendors, with cafes and bars offering all you need to while away a few hours with irresistible eats. From Po’Boys to vegan kebabs, be at the cutting edge of Margate’s food scene in a picturesque seaside setting.
      - id: mannings-seafood
        title: Mannings Seafood
        description: This stalwart seafood stop is a nostalgic flavour of old Margate. Fresh oysters, jellied eels, cockles and more are cheap and plentiful, with dousings of vinegar and pepper for a typical seaside snack. Since 1962 this small shack has offered true seaside fayre – yet as old school as it is, they know what the people want. That’s why you can now order prosecco and oysters, with small picnic tables offering sea views as you slurp up some of the finest (and cheapest!) seafood in the town.
      - id: fort-road-yard
        title: Fort Road Yard
        description: Shops are old hat; yards are the new in thing. Fort Road Yard is an exceptionally cool space filled with fairground pieces (Dreamland anyone?) and industrial salvage that makes for killer statement pieces. Browse the shacks that line the yard for more vintage treasures, alongside tiny galleries that house local art. Fort Road Yard is a mecca for unique mid-century kitsch, hidden just behind the seafront ready for modernist treasure hunters.

  - id: sandwich
    title: Sandwich
    description: This remarkable little town is an untouched medieval treasure. Once a hugely important medieval port that rivalled London, it slowly sidled into obscurity in the 16th century, when the waters filled with silt and ruined the harbour. For this reason, there’s a wealth of fantastic medieval buildings here, with the majority of the town’s centre having listed status. Riverside dining and creaky, timbered pubs make this a truly charming Kentish getaway, with plenty of historical sights to explore, seal spotting tours to embark on, and all the country indulgence you would expect.
