  intro: One of the blessings (and curses) of working for Secret Escapes, is that I'm constantly holiday planning, resulting in most of my annual leave being accounted for by 2nd January. With this in mind, I love to make the most of my weekends, squeezing in trips wherever possible; so heading to the beautiful Kentish coast for a weekend out of London with pals was just the ticket.

  - title: Calling at...
    content: >
      <p>After a busy day of work, me and two friends zipped along to London St Pancras, escaping the heat of the city for a healthy dose of sea air over the weekend. Winding down with ice-cold beers, train treats and a game of cards kicked things off perfectly, and before my most competitive of mates could have a sense of humour failure in an overheated game of Cheat, we'd whizzed through the countryside and arrived in Ramsgate just 1 hour and 15 minutes later and right on time for dinner. </p>

  - title: A seaside retreat
    content: >
      <p>After checking in to Albion House, a beautiful, boutique hotel set in a quintessential Regency seaside townhouse, we were lucky enough to witness an epic sunset over the water from the comfort of our very own room. Taking in the views of the seagulls swooping over the bobbing boats in the harbour, and the bustling arches beyond, it soon became very clear that Ramsgate had a lot more to offer than the biggest Wetherspoons in the world (although we did sample this too of course). Its own attractions aside, Ramsgate was an ideal launching pad for a picturesque walk along the coast; from the impressive houses and quaint cobbled alleyways of Broadstairs, to the stunning beach of Botany Bay (perfect for a dip on the weekend we were there) and the youthful and creative hub of Margate.</p>

  - title: Arrive hungry
    content: >
      <p>You can forget about wrestling with sandy sandwiches along this stretch of coast; with recommendations coming out of our ears, we wanted to pack in all the sustenance we could fathom, from higgledy piggledy pubs and tea houses, to fine dining and relaxed seaside fare. </p>
      <p>Gourmet highlights included our hotel, Albion House, which served up locally-sourced dishes and signature cocktails in its fairy lit, botanically-themed dining room on Ramsgate's seafront. </p>
      <p>Sweeping views and beachy scenes aside, a stroll along the coast to Broadstairs, was worth it for steaming bowls of freshly caught mussels at family-run, seafront spot, Wyatt & Jones, and the creamy, soft gelato of famed Morelli's. This brightly-coloured, formica-tabled institution was nirvana for an ice cream lover like me (and the queues of people waiting for their gelato hit), and we were more than ready for a mint choc-chip pick-me-up after our 40-minute stroll from Ramsgate. </p>
      <p>For Margate, my foodie tip would be to arrive hungry; this seafront hotspot has the perfect venue for every occasion. For a grab-and-go spot for lunch or drinks, the Old Kent Market – housed in a former cinema – is home to a double decker bus bar, fresh-from-the-oven hot cross buns at Gina’s, Neapolitan pizzas and more. For dinner or a slap-up Sunday lunch, head to neighbourhood favourite and newly expanded Hantverk & Found, where a daily-changing menu of seafood specialities cooked up with love and care, saw us tucking into an incredible Monkfish curry and fresh lobster. For something a little more low-key, the small-yet-perfectly-formed Cheesy Tiger, wins big in the toasty league table and serves up affordable delights and all-natural wine from arguably the best spot in town – on Margate’s harbour arm.</p>

  - title: Vibrant culture
    content: >
      <p>From small and independent galleries in Ramsgate's arches to Bleak House in Broadstairs (where Dickens penned his masterpiece) and the Grade-II listed tidal pool at Walpole Bay, there's plenty of culture and things to do packed into this short stretch of Kentish coastline before you even reach Margate. </p>
      <p>In Margate itself, the Turner Contemporary is set on the beachfront on the site of the boarding house where J.M.W. Turner himself stayed, and is home to works by former resident, Tracey Emin and more. The real jewel in Margate's cultural crown though was the epic Shell Grotto; a subterranean showstopper adorned head to toe in ornate mosaics using over four million shells. One of life's true and rare mysteries, this shell cave was discovered in 1835 and no one seems to know who, why or how this intriguing treasure trove was created; we, naturally, spent the rest of our time there debating our own theories – from the sinister to the downright splendid.</p>

  - title: Long live the independents
    content: >
      <p>A mix between pretty cute and pretty gaudy, Margate is a curiously wonderful place for shopping. With more vintage shops than you could shake a stick of rock at, it can be quite overwhelming to know where to start. Its best kept secret is RG Scott’s in Cliftonville, famous for its dealings in retro and antique furniture, and ‘Junk Deluxe’- a treasure trove brimming with anything and everything, from neon signs to mannequins. Elsewhere, Mor sells stylish homeware, accessories and lifestyle goods from independent designers, Haeckels produces all-natural cosmetics made from local seaweed and Artisans & Adventures champions sustainable design, sourcing ethical brands from across the world.</p>

  - title: At the disco...
    content: >
      <p>As a rule of thumb, I feel like anywhere that has a roller disco is a guaranteed great time and Margate didn't disappoint. We kicked off our evening donning the wheels, limbering up and busting some moves (AKA clinging onto the side for dear life) in Margate's fairground-on-sea, Dreamland. Home to a giant ferris wheel, rides, a huge arcade and a music venue, where big name DJ's and 'By the Sea' festival is hosted, Dreamland has a year-long programme of events to suit varied tastes.</p>
      <p>Other nightlife spots of note included the cosy Lifeboat Ale & Cider House, a tiny pub with a big selection of ales, and perfect people-watching tables outside. For a sunset tipple, I'd recommend heading to the Harbour Arms pub (right next to our dinner spot, Cheesy Tiger), where punters can take their drinks onto the roof al-fresco style to take in views over the water. While it's slim pickings for dance-the-night-away venues in Margate, unanimous tip-offs from the locals told us that Sundowners, a gay bar set in a seafront townhouse where most of the town seemed to have congregated on a Saturday, was the place to be; a true Margate institution.</p>

  - title: The train home...
    content: >
      <p>This Ramsgate-Margate stretch of coast really ticked all our boxes for a weekend getaway; close to London and easy to get to after work, get-away-from-it-all sea air and great opportunities for coastal walks, plenty of independent shops, a healthy dose of culture, cosy pubs and incredible dining. With Ramsgate, Broadstairs and Margate being different in their own way, yet close enough together to experience all three in one weekend, we were pleasantly surprised to feel like all bases had been covered and we returned to London feeling like we'd been on holiday; relaxed, rejuvenated, a few pounds heavier and already plotting when we would return.</p>
