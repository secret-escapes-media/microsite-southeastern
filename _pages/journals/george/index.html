  intro: Hey! When I’m not busy working at Secret Escapes I’m always on the lookout for great weekends away with my family. With two kids to keep happy, there’s plenty to consider – so an easy train ride from London into the beautiful Kent countryside was a tempting proposition...

  - title: Calling at...
    content: >
      <p>My wife Emma and I, together with the kids, headed for London St Pancras. We were quick to grab a table seat and I managed to beat my boy Zack to a window seat – he wasn’t impressed. But I quickly distracted him with some crisps and pop, as we all settled in for a pleasant journey through the countryside. We’d done this journey into Kent before in the car. After being stuck on the M25 for nearly four hours this journey, of little over an hour, was an absolute breeze!</p>

  - title: A quaint city

      <p>As I left Canterbury West station and rounded the corner onto St. Dunstans St, I was instantly hit by the grand sight of the West Gate. Its impressive size and medieval design set the tone for the High Street that it guarded – an incredibly quaint street that feels very much like a scene from Harry Potter. I love taking photographs and the High Street and the small lanes running off it were exceptionally photogenic. The architecture is beautiful with plenty of views catching my eye – a far cry from the city, that’s for sure!</p>

  - title: Dining with the family
    content: >
      <p>Considering Canterbury has never ranked high on my foodie radar – in fact I’d go as far as to say I’d never considered it as a great place to eat – I was completely won-over by what we discovered. The team highlight (we had a family vote you know) included a quite delicious meal at The Goods Shed on Friday night. It’s a great restaurant that doubles up as a market during the day, championing local produce. Unlike their parents, the kids weren't going to be sold so easily with the words "local produce" or "organic"; but after some clever questioning the lovely staff  created a lovely child-sized sausage and mash for the kids and they wolfed it down. The homemade lemonade was an absolute triumph. The manager Sarah was a delight and you could clearly see she really cared about what was being served, with a clear core concept of good, local food that she had worked so hard to build up.</p>
      <p>For dessert, make a stop at Creams British Ice Cream. On both nights we ended up at this place as the ice cream was unreal. The sight of so many different flavours was enough to make even us big kids smile. If you get a chance, go hunt this place out, it’s the best way to end a night!</p>

  - title: A Gothic scene
    content: >
      <p>Canterbury was steeped in history. Every street seemed to hide a story, leaving Emma and I feeling far less pressure to rush to the nearest museum or gallery. What struck us most was the Gothic architecture that was so prevalent across the entire city. Even high street retail shops seemed to be tactfully built into the existing medieval walls and wooden-beamed buildings. One of the finest examples of this architecture was Christchurch gate – an incredibly grand gate that acted as the entrance to the cathedral on the edge of The Old Buttermarket.</p>
      <p>Although very content with pounding the streets we couldn’t resist taking a boat trip (rather, a punt) down the hidden river Stour. Our 50-minute boat ride was such a welcomed escape from the busy streets – I realised the business was actually owned and run by one family, with the dad and two brothers at the core of it. If you're feet are truly aching I highly recommend doing this – it’s a great way of seeing the inside and outside of the city.</p>

  - title: Independent shopping
    content: >
      <p>Like most cities Canterbury has a really impressive shopping centre – Whitefriars – which acts as the go-to place for anyone after a serious bit of retail therapy. However, what’s truly lovely is that the centre of the city, and in fact the high street, remains totally dominated by independents. With only 48 hours in this great place I had officially banned the family from any big shopping splurge, but I couldn't pull my wife away from some of the more quirky art and craft outlets. It was very evident there was a healthy creative talent amongst the Canterbury locals and small galleries and art shops were in no shortage.</p>
      <p>We also took a small trip up to Faversham, an easy 10-minute train away, to explore its renowned market. The short walk to the station would take us along the castle walls with great views of the city and past Dane John Mound. The journey to Faversham was done in a blink. Once there I've never seen a town so dominated by market trade. My wife Emma was in her element with beautifully designed clothes and jewellery stands dotted along the streets. Unsurprisingly my kids just made a dart for the cake stools (in particular, the aptly named "Nice Buns" totally won us over with their tray-baked cakes). If you have a morning to kill i'd highly recommend a visit.</p>

  - title: A family destination
    content: >
      <p>With a great mix of fascinating sights and great shops, plus plenty of green space, Canterbury was a superb spot for me and my family. The town was surprisingly youthful, owing to a local student population, making the city vibrant enough to offer great places to eat and drink. The kids were quietly content with all the food presented to them and we were even more impressed. Walking the city walls and climbing Dane John Mound, plus boat trips and sweet shops galore, meant the kids were never without entertainment. The centre of Canterbury is also mainly pedestrianised, making it a perfect place for a young family.</p>

  - title: The train home...
    content: >
      <p>As we settled in to our seats, with plenty of great Canterbury sweets and treats laid out on the table, I could tell that the Hiles family had had a great weekend away. I'd gone from being asked "do we have to go Dad" by my daughter prior to trip to "when can we go back", asked by the same little lady as she trotted off to school on the following Monday. Canterbury’s obvious draw is the cathedral and the famous Chaucer tales, but we found ourselves so distracted by incredible hidden gems that we didn’t even get round to seeing the thing! There’s more here waiting for us, along with plenty of stop-offs on the route that we missed this time around. We’ll be back!</p>
